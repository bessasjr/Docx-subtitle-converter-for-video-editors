Docx subtitle converter for video editing or creating custom text screens (with GRAPHIC INTERFACE)

This program converts each LINE of a DOCX file into a PNG image, with transparency, with the line sentence centered at the bottom. Can be used for video subtitling, creating custom subtitles.
It generates a sequence of screens with subtitles, which can be inserted above the video layer in a timeline, in a video editor, for example.
Manually, depending on the size of the text, creating these files can be a tedious and time-consuming task. With this program you can save a lot of time, as large texts, which would often take a long time to generate the image files, are converted by the program in seconds.
