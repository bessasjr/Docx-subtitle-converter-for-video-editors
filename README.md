# Docx subtitle converter for video editors

There are a few ways to subtitle videos these days. One of the most used ways (not the most practical lately), is to convert the subtitle sentence by sentence into image files with transparency, which will be inserted in a layer above the video to be subtitled and adjusted according to the transcript. you speak. Depending on the size of the subtitle, creating these files can be quite tedious and time-consuming work.
This program does this autonomously, which, in addition to saving the editor's effort, saves a lot of time, because large subtitles, which would often take hours to generate the image files, are converted by the program in seconds.
The program converts each LINE of a DOCX file into a PNG image, with transparency, with the line phrase centered at the bottom.
It generates a sequence of screens with subtitles, which can be inserted above the video layer in a timeline, in a video editor.
